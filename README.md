#### The goal of the competition is to predict which parts will fail quality control
#### My goal is to utilize the hadoop ecosystem to handle a large dataset and establish a pipeline for machine learning

#### [`munge`](src/munge.py) :
- Aggregate columns using RDD transformations
- Create a column that indicates which of those column aggregations are outliers.

#### [`fit_predict`](src/fit_predict.py) :
- Model data with Spark Machine Learning package
- Predict on test data

#### [`munge_fit_predict`](src/munge_fit_predict.py) :
- Run this as is to use the toy data set example
