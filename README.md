- 81% of the dataset is empty - of the roughly one million rows, on average each row has 
- The classes are highly imbalanced: *0.58% failed.*

[The data are munged into a lower dimension utilizing Apache-Spark's DataFrame class. Each record is summarized by counts of outliers and the count of non null values. All of that is done with myMunge.py](myMunge.py)


The munged data is then modeled with Spark Machine Learning package.
